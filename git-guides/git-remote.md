# Git Remote

There are some operations with `git remote`, like `git remote -v`, that you may use occasionally.

But, the concept of a remote within Git is important and powers many of the other operations.

## Communicating with the remote

- git push
- git clone
- git pull
- git fetch

## Branches and the remote

### Remote tracking branches
- what they are
- deleting them
- why they don't take up so much room

### Local working branches 

## Push unsuccessful

If there are changes on the remote that you don't have yet, you won't be able to push. First, you need to pull.
